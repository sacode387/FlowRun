## Code organization
Project has 2 parts:
- interpreter, which contains all of the logic for the editor/interpreter
- editor, which contains all of the logic for the editor/interpreter
- demo, contains demo code that uses core

Core can be production-optimized with `core/fullLinkJS`.  
The JS code will be generated in `core\target\scala-3.1.0\flowrun-opt\main.js`.
